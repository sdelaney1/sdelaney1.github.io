<h1>Hello! I'm Shannon.
</h1>
<h4><a href="work.html">I'm a visual communicator, design thinker and community enthusiast living in Chicago.</a></h4>

<p>
  My work leads me to the crossroads of creativity and community. I've studied and worked as a visual communicator, which continues
  to inform my visual arts practice. Iâ€™ve taught drawing and poetry to high school students, all-sorts-of-crafts to adult
  learners, and foundational skills to youth with special needs. Studying Community Informatics in the field of Library and
  Information Sciences brought a new understanding of data to my experience with people and the stories surrounding them.
  I take these things with me as the path develops beneath my feet.
