  <p>
    My work leads me to the crossroads of creativity and community. I've studied and worked as a visual communicator,
    which continues to inform my visual arts practice. Iâ€™ve taught drawing and poetry to high school students, all-sorts-of-crafts
    to adult learners, and foundational skills to youth with special needs. Studying Community Informatics in the field of
    Library and Information Sciences brought a new understanding of data to my experience with people and the stories surrounding
    them. I take these things with me as the path develops beneath my feet.
