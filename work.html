    In the Fall of 2016, a team of student designers at IIT Institute of Design (ID) partnered with the Illinois Department of
    Human Services (DHS) to better understand the users of their Home Services Program (HSP). The HSP provides services to
    individuals with severe disabilities so they can live as independently as possible. We visited customers in their homes,
    met with care providers at training facilities, sat with administration about their work. Meeting with stakeholders led
    our curiosities, as we've aimed to experience the program through the diverse perspectives within it. By hosting a co-creation
    workshop, we shared insights from our research, and together we explored opportunities for service experience improvement
    within the HSP. We analyzed, we synthesized. We built on surfaced opportunities and presented packaged concepts to all
    stakeholders, seeding a conversation about opportunities for design concepts and planning to impact process improvement
    within government agencies in Illinois. This Spring, we move these ideas forward, prototyping solutions with the same
    people we aim to serve in this research. <a href="contact.html">Ask me about developments.</a></p>
